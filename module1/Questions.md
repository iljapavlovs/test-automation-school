* Will this snippet code work if element is not found on the page? If not, then why?
    ```
    driver.findElement(By.id("some_id").isDisplayed())
    ```
* Why there is no isPresent() method for WebElement interface?
* Which interface is responsible for controling the browser and finding DOM elements?
* Which interface is intended for interacting with DOM elements?
* Name all the WebElement locating mechanisms?
* What `driver.findElement(...)` method returns?
* What is the argument to `driver.findElement(...)` method?
* Which class defines different locating mechanisms?
* What is the difference when element is displayed or present?
* How to retrieve multiple elements at once? What would be variable type for referencing such Java object?
* How to bypass _NoSuchElementException_ if there is no gurantee that element will be found on the page?
